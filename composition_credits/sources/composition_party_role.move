/// Defines the roles that parties can hold on a composition.
/// Compositions are the underlying musical works (melody + lyrics), and these
/// roles represent the writing and adaptation contributions to them.
///
/// ### Design
///
/// `CompositionPartyRole` is a closed enum: variants can only be constructed and
/// matched inside this module, so the `new_*_role` constructors are the external
/// write-API and `name()` is the external read-API.
///
/// - **No seniority axis.** Unlike recording roles, composition roles carry no
///   level — a writer either contributed in a given capacity or did not.
/// - **`Custom` is the escape hatch.** The canonical variants cover the common
///   writing vocabulary; anything outside it is a `Custom(name)` whose name is
///   validated. Prefer a canonical variant when one fits.
/// - **`name()` is the canonical identifier**, returned as a stable PascalCase
///   token (e.g. `"Songwriter"`). For `Custom`, `name()` returns the
///   user-supplied string.
///
/// These identifiers are Miso's own canonical vocabulary; any overlap with an
/// external standard (e.g. DDEX) is coincidental, not a reproduction of it.
