/// The parental advisory rating for a recording — whether its lyrics are
/// explicit — stored as a dynamic field on the recording's UID and written
/// through its cap-gated `uid_mut`.
///
/// This is its own package on purpose. Advisory ratings are set by a different
/// person, at a different time, for entirely different reasons than the other
/// facts about a recording, and the standard that governs them moves on its own
/// schedule. Bundling it into a general "recording metadata" object would mean
/// that revising the advisory standard drags every unrelated field through the
/// migration. Kept separate, a consumer implementing some future metadata
/// profile selects this extension or ignores it, and swapping it touches
/// nothing else.
///
/// The rating is deliberately not a boolean. Every distributor and storefront
/// distinguishes a *cleaned* edit — an explicit recording re-issued with the
/// offending content removed — from a recording that was never explicit at all.
/// They are merchandised differently and a boolean cannot express the
/// difference, so `Cleaned` is a first-class variant.
///
/// Attaching the extension IS the statement. There is no "attached but
/// undeclared" state: if a rating is present it has been asserted by the rights
/// holder, and a recording with nothing attached has simply said nothing.
