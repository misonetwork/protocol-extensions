/// Defines the roles that parties can hold on a recording.
/// Recordings are audio performances of compositions, and these roles
/// represent the various production and performance contributions.
///
/// ### Design
///
/// `RecordingPartyRole` is a closed enum: variants can only be constructed and
/// matched inside this module, so the `new_*_role` constructors are the external
/// write-API and `name()` is the external read-API.
///
/// - **Seniority is a separate axis.** Most roles carry an optional
///   `RecordingPartyRoleLevel` (Lead, Assistant, Additional, …). Industry
///   variants like "Second Engineer" or "Additional Producer" are expressed as a
///   base role plus a level, not as their own variants — this keeps the role set
///   compact without losing the distinction.
/// - **`Custom` is the escape hatch.** The canonical variants cover the common
///   vocabulary; anything outside it is a `Custom(name, level)` whose name is
///   validated like an instrument name. Prefer a canonical variant when one fits.
/// - **`name()` is the canonical identifier**, returned as a stable PascalCase
///   token (e.g. `"MixingEngineer"`). It doubles as an on-chain match key and as
///   the seed for off-chain display/localization. For `Custom`, `name()` returns
///   the user-supplied string; for `Instrumentalist`, it returns
///   `"Instrumentalist"` (the instrument itself is read off-chain).
///
/// These identifiers are Miso's own canonical vocabulary; any overlap with an
/// external standard (e.g. DDEX) is coincidental, not a reproduction of it.
