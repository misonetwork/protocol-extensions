/// A pointer to a recording's master audio — nothing more.
///
/// The value is a bare `ori::WalrusData` blob reference. This extension makes no
/// claim about what the blob contains: not its codec, not its sample rate, not
/// its duration, not that it is even audio. The only assertion is that the
/// holder of the recording's admin cap says this blob is the master. Everything
/// else is client-side convention.
///
/// That thinness is the point. Miso's attested path — the Nautilus-verified
/// master flow (`audio_ingester` producing a `miso_audio::Audio`), deferred —
/// carries channel count, bit depth, sample rate, sample count and a PCM digest,
/// and every one of those is backed by a Nautilus enclave signature over the
/// measured audio. Until that path is running, stating the same fields
/// *unverified* would dress an assertion up as a measurement. A pointer cannot
/// be mistaken for a measurement.
///
/// # This extension is a holdover
///
/// It exists to carry the catalogue until enclave ingestion is ready, and it is
/// meant to be removed rather than grown. When a recording's master is ingested
/// for real, attach the attested master via the ingester's master flow and call
/// `unset_master_reference` here. The two never need to coexist, and this package
/// deliberately holds nothing the attested path cannot restate.
///
/// Resist adding fields. Anything worth asserting about the audio is worth
/// attesting, and belongs in the ingested `Audio` rather than here.
