/// Defines the roles that parties can hold on a release.
/// Releases are the commercial packaging of recordings (an album, single, EP),
/// and a release credit captures top-line billing: a party is either a primary
/// artist or a featured artist on the release.
///
/// ### Design
///
/// `ReleasePartyRole` is a closed enum: variants can only be constructed and
/// matched inside this module, so the `new_*_role` constructors are the external
/// write-API and `name()` is the external read-API.
///
/// - **No level axis and no `Custom` escape hatch.** Release billing is a small,
///   fixed vocabulary: `Primary` or `Featured`.
/// - **`name()` is the canonical identifier**, returned as a stable PascalCase
///   token (`"Primary"` / `"Featured"`).
///
/// These identifiers are Miso's own canonical vocabulary; any overlap with an
/// external standard (e.g. DDEX) is coincidental, not a reproduction of it.
