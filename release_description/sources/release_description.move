/// A free string, deliberately. Nothing on-chain reads it and nothing derives
/// from it: this is editorial prose, not a fact the protocol can check. The
/// facts a release carries that *are* checkable — its tracklist, its splits, its
/// state — live on the core object, and the claims two releases have to agree
/// about to be comparable (genre, credits, languages) each get their own typed
/// extension so they can be queried rather than read. What is left over is what
/// a person wants to say, and the only useful thing to do with it is store it
/// and attribute it to the cap holder.
///
/// One slot, not a set. A release has one thing to say about itself; per-track
/// notes and per-language translations are different concerns and would be
/// different extensions. Folding either in here would turn a paragraph into a
/// schema, and a schema is exactly what prose is not.
///
/// The 8 KB ceiling is storage hygiene, not an editorial opinion — a backstop
/// against pathological bloat in a shared object, deliberately set well above
/// any description anyone is expected to write. It is the most generous free-text
/// bound in the stack, and that is the intended asymmetry: this package publishes
/// immutable, so a ceiling that turns out to be too low can never be raised,
/// while one that is too high costs only the gas of the writer who fills it. A
/// description is also edited rarely, so the cost of rewriting the field in full
/// lands on almost nobody.
///
/// Genuinely long-form writing — an essay, a full set of liner notes — still
/// belongs where the artwork goes, in a Walrus blob referenced by an extension.
/// Nothing here stops someone using the whole 8 KB; the bound is a limit, not a
/// recommendation.
///
/// Attaching nothing and attaching a description are distinct states: absence
/// means nobody has written one, which is why an empty string is rejected rather
/// than stored. There is no such thing as an empty description.
