# `release_genre`

> Pure genre metadata for a Miso `Release`.

The package attaches one primary genre, up to five secondary genres, and
optional per-track primary overrides to a release through its cap-gated
`&mut UID`. It does not implement reward eligibility, timing restrictions, or
other economic policy.

The primary genre can be replaced at any time by the release administrator.
Primary and secondary genres remain disjoint, and every track override is
validated against the release's tracklist.

## Publishing

This simplified data layout is intentionally incompatible with the historical
version 1 package. It must be published under a fresh package ID rather than
upgraded from that deployment.
