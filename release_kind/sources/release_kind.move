/// What a release calls itself — "Album", "EP", "Mixtape", "Split" — asserted by
/// whoever holds the release's admin cap, and believed.
///
/// Deliberately a free string rather than an enum. An enum would not decide the
/// classification (the admin still picks) but it would decide the *menu*, and
/// deciding which self-descriptions are legitimate is not the protocol's job.
/// Artists release beat tapes and splits and things nobody has named yet; a
/// closed set would make each of those a package swap, and in the meantime would
/// quietly push releases into whichever official-looking box fit worst.
///
/// Nothing here derives the value or checks it for plausibility. A four-track
/// release may call itself an Album and a twelve-track one an EP; both happen,
/// and the artist's intent is the fact worth recording. The only checks are
/// structural — non-empty and bounded — so the field stays storable.
///
/// This is the opposite call from `release_genre`, on purpose. Genre is a
/// curated vocabulary because discovery and reward-eligibility depend on releases
/// agreeing with each other about what a genre *is*. Nothing depends on two
/// releases agreeing about what an EP is.
///
/// The cost of that freedom lands on readers: "EP", "ep" and "Extended Play" are
/// three distinct values here. Clients that group or facet by kind should
/// normalise (case-fold at minimum) rather than expect canonical strings.
